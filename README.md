Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, Fine Tuning, Data Augmentation, VGG-16, ResNet-18, Classification, Keras

## 1. Objective

* To try to implement CNN code, which uses pretrained networks.
* To compare 2 pretrained networks by changing conditions.
* Considering cases are below;

|Case|Network|Learning Paradigm|Data Augmentation|
---|---|---|---
|1|VGG16|Transfer Learning|Do|
|2|//|//|Not Do|
|3|//|Fine Tuning|Do|
|4|//|//|Not Do|
|5|ResNet18|Transfer Learning|Do|
|6|//|//|Not Do|
|7|//|Fine Tuning|Do|
|8|//|//|Not Do|

## 2. Theme for Classification

* Define the theme as the classification task of characters which appears in Star Wars movie.
* Actually, choose "C3PO", "R2D2", and "chewbacca".
* Those pictures are searched on the net.

## 3. Implementation
